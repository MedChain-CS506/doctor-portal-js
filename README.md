# MEDCHAIN

## Description

MedChain is a fully decentralized, Ethereum-based application, which looks to provide medical professionals in developing countries with easy access to their patient's medical files and prescriptions, simply through their aadhaar numbers. While there are many improvements to still be made, this is only one example of what benefits this technology can provide.

## Instructions for launching application

### First, install these tools to build and run the application

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- Next, run this in your terminal to install truffle (which will be used to compile and deploy the smart contracts)

  ~~~~bash
  npm install truffle -g
  ~~~~

- Open Ganache, click on Quickstart. Then copy the RPC Server address (it is `http://127.0.0.1:7545` by default)
- Open MetaMask, create an account (this account will be used to login in to MetaMask anytime you want to use this browser wallet estension. It is very important to follow MetaMask directions in creating your accont)
- then:
  - Clik Network in the top middle, then choose Custom RPC
  - Type a name (anything would work, 'Ganache' is usefule to indicate that your are connecting to Ganache network)
  - Paste the RPC address that you copied form Ganache (`http://127.0.0.1:7545`)
  - Import private keys into MetaMask:(you need at least one account to be able to compile and deploye the smart contracts, so this step is crucial for the rest of the steps to work).
    - One way:
      - From MetaMask, click on the logo at the top right
      - Click create account, then click creaet (This will will create an account using one of your Ganache account's private keys, as long as you are succesfully connected to Ganache network)
    - Alternatively:
      - Go to Ganache, and chose whatever account you want to import
      - Click on the key logo to the left of the that account
      - Copy the private key
      - Go back to MetaMask
      - Click the logo on the top right, then choose import account
      - Paste the private key, then click import

### Next, navigate inside the app's directory from a terminal

- Once inside the root directory, run the script `./run_blockchain`
- Additionally, you can test the smart contract by running `truffle test` (again, from the root directory)

### Now, you can run the client app on your localhost by:

~~~~bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
~~~~

## Folder Breakdown

- client
  - \_mocks\_
  - public
  - src
    - components - Building blocks of the client application
      - layout - reusable components that exist on multiple pages
        - Dialog - A type of modal window, that appears in front of app content to ask for a decision. Used them to create new patient forms or prescriptions.
        - Loading - Displayed when user is not currently signed in through MetaMask
        - Navbar - Headers used for navigation and toggle buttons.
      - pages - components that react router will direct to
        - Landing - The first initial page the user lands on. Can begin by entering a new patient or search for an existing one
        - NotFound - a 404, route-not-found page
        - Profile - The requested profile searched for by the doctor or the pharmacist. Here, they can access a patient's prescription history, while a doctor can also access a patient's basic information as well as any medical files.
    - context - State management tool that passes state to different components
      - patient - The current state of patients, which is drawn out from our Ethereum blockchain
    - utils - Additional utilities used throughout the application
      - theme - allows the toggling between Material UI's light and dark theme
      - getWeb3 - allows for access to web3
      - aadhaar - validates aadhaar entries
  - .env
  - .eslintrc
  - babel.config.js
  - add.js
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
- contracts
  - MedChain.sol
  - Migrations.sol

  - 1_initial_migration.js
  - 2_deploy_contracts.js
- test
- LICENSE
- run_blockchain.sh - shell script that runs 'truffle compile' and 'truffle migrate'
